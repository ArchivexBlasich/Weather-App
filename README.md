Weather Forecast App
In this project I practiced working with APIs by building a weather forecast website using the Visual Crossing API. 
The app allows users to search for a location, view the current weather, and toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 
I also explored handling JSON data, updating the DOM dynamically, and styling the page based on weather conditions.
